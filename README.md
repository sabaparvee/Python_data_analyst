Overview You are a data analyst and your client has a large ecommerce company in India (let’s call it X). X gets a thousand orders via their website on a daily basis and they have to deliver them as fast as they can. For delivering the goods ordered by the customers, X has tied up with multiple courier companies in India as delivery partners who charge them some amount per delivery. The charges are dependent upon two factors: ● Weight of the product and the Price of the product. ● Distance between the warehouse (pickup location) and customer’s delivery address (destination location) On an average, the delivery charges are Rs. 100 per shipment. So if X ships 1,00,000 orders per month, they have to pay approximately Rs. 1 crore to the courier companies on a monthly basis as charges. As the amount that X has to pay to the courier companies is very high, they want to verify if the charges levied by their Delivery partners per Order are correct.
